name: Overworld Events
description: Text in the event pop-ups players encounter on overworld map. Includes overall name for the event, header and body of each step, and header and body of each custom option. All event text keys are prefixed with "ev_". Since options can be reused in multiple steps, so they are listed after all step text, not mixed together. Some options are reused across multiple events - for instance, very generic responses like "Cancel", which shouldn't be duplicated per event (you can find them by looking for "os_" prefix instead of event name).

      Smoke Screens are useful for avoiding combat when being attacked by hostile squads, providing you with enough cover to escape. The mobile base only has space to safely store three smoke canisters.



      They can only be manufactured in liberated territories when interacting with structures that do not have an enemy garrison.

      The man wears a well-worn hat and leather gloves. His smile is a little too genial for your liking, and he takes you by the arm.



      "Ah, so I suppose you must be the one in charge here," he says. "Good, good. So I know you'll be wise enough to recognise how good this deal is."



      He shows you the equipment in the back of his truck. He's right, it does look good.

      Once a mining facility, the Felheim Base was later retrofitted as an emergency mech storage depot, built to support the forces of the homeland should they need them. When the invasion began, the country was overrun too quickly for anyone to utilize it. This abandoned place could serve us well if we manage to dispatch the enemy forces guarding it!


      People of this province become more hopeful when the Brigade defeats Invaders, and so capturing Felheim will mean Hope rises here. With enough Hope, the region is liberated. More information about the province's Hope level can be found under its name.

      The base approaches a quiet village. Many of the houses have shattered windows and broken doors, and you can see scorch marks from fire.


      You and one of your pilots get out to look around. You eventually come across a group of people who are helping to collect the scattered belongings of one of the villagers.


      "What happened here?" your pilot asks.


      One of the women helping looks up, and she points towards the deep tracks left tanks and mechs.


      "We were raided," she says. Her voice is thick. "We tried to look for help, but no one came…"


      You and your pilot give your apologies, and help them gather the last of the villager's items, before you make the long trek back to the base. Once the rest of your team hear what happened, the rest of the day's journey in the base is spent mostly in silence.

      If you lose all of your units and pilots at any point, you can fall back to this base and rebuild. Retreating gives a new squad fitted with essential equipment (at the same level as the highest level province you control).


      Now that Felheim has been liberated, you should start making your way to the capital while liberating as many provinces as you can.

      Military structures are usually more challenging than roaming squads or occupied settlements and facilities. However, they also store better loot and have units with higher quality gear.


      You can inspect units on the battlefield and check their equipment. Being careful can pay off if you're after particular gear: the direction from which you attack a target can change the likelihood of destroying a part. For instance, attacking from behind is more likely to damage the legs.

      Once combat begins, it's important to manage heat levels of your units.Mechs will produce heat whenever they use their weapons or dash. This heat dissipates over time. Left to climb, it will begin to cause damage until a mech is cooled down. A mech can be destroyed by heat damage, leading to automatic ejection of the pilot.

      His clothes are filthy, and there's an ugly bruise on his forehead. If it's an ambush, it's more elaborate than any you've seen.

      The enemy pilot spits on the ground. "Didn't want to do this stuff anymore. It isn't right."
