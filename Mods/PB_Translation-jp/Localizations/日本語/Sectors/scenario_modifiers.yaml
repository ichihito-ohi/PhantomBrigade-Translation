    text: Activate the comm jammer. Prevent squads nearby from joining this fight. Normally, squads aware of the player base will help any hostile you engage and join the fight, but using the jammer charge will disrupt communications and prevent them from arriving in time. Useful when you're being chased by multiple patrols and ill-equipped to take them on all at once.

    temp: true
    text: Radio for help
  call_home_guard__text:
    temp: true
    text: Thanks to your reputation with the Home Guard, you can call their forces to join this fight. Doing this will cost 1 reputation point. A victory with no Home Guard losses will increase your reputation by 1. The strength of their forces will depend on your total reputation.
